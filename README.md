# 🛌 Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

This project explores how different lifestyle and biological factors affect sleep health using a real-world dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to uncover patterns related to stress, physical activity, sleep quality, and sleep disorders using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

## 📊 Visualizations Performed

| Question | Plot Type |
|----------|-----------|
| Stress level vs Quality of Sleep | `Regplot` |
| Physical activity vs Sleep duration/quality | `Regplot` |
| Age group vs Sleep disorder | `Barplot` |
| Gender-wise sleep patterns | `Violinplot` |
| Occupation vs Stress/Sleep disorder | `Heatmap` |
| BMI Category vs Sleep Disorder | `Heatmap` |
